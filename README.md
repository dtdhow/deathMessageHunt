# deathMessageHunt
Who can get the most unique death messages?

This is my first minecraft plugin.

  How to setup the minecraft plugin:

Insert this plugin into the servers plugin folder

Go to the server and enter these commands:
  /minecraft:scoreboard objectives add deaths dummy "Death Message Hunt"
  /minecraft:scoreboard objectives setdisplay list deaths

And you are done!
